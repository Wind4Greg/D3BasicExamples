# Basic D3 Examples with Explanations

D3 Concepts, features, and their explanations with examples. [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) is a very powerful data visualization library, however some of its concepts can be a bit un-intuitive for some of us.

Here we aim to have some basic examples to illustrate key D3 features and functionality along with their explanations. One other goal is to show how different features can be used separately.

Topics to be covered:

* HTML DOM modification with D3
* SVG drawing via D3
* Scales
* Data binding mechanisms and Data Updates
* Drag
* Zoom
* Layouts/Graphs?

## Who are you?

A part time lecturer in computer science along with students in an advanced web development class who are interested in D3.js, SVG, and other JavaScript based data visualization techniques.

## Prerequisites

Basics web development, see for example [Website Development for CS Majors](https://www.grotto-networking.com/WebsiteDevelopment/WebDev.html). Also see [MDN Learn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn).

## Building Examples

We prefer to use ES6 style imports and a bundler ([Parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/)) this way you don't need an internet connection when running the example.

## D3 and React

Examples for two "extreme" approaches: 
1. "Giving the DOM to D3" in a Component
2. D3 for everything but DOM manipulations.
